              <h2>Make Self Control Sexy Again</h2>
              <p>When I was studying Clinical Neuroscience, it occurred to me that many Neurological Disorders are cureless, but can have a significant reduction in likelihood with appropriate Preventative Health Practices.</p>
              <p>As many in Health, this sent me down a rabbit hole of learning, and trying different tech out.</p>
              <p>I couldn’t find any systems that I was happy with. I hit a lot of obstacles and was constantly getting frustrated and trying something new. Each time, the builders got some things right, but also some things wrong: the sensors were either low quality (ruining the value of their insights), or the sensors / insights only worked for a specific population, or the insights were poor (no discussion of the relationship between your data), or they are inundating you with way too much information, or the UI was so oversimplified that I couldn’t see any of the logic or methods they used to give me my scores, or the insights offered were only focussed on short term goals (eg train for a one-off marathon).</p>
              <p>I started talking to my friends and realised that a lot of them were facing similar issues. They were trying to use data from the wearables they already wore, or the Drs appointments they went to, and couldn’t find any straightforward ways to store the data or get useful/understandable information out of them.</p>
              <p>I ended up adjusting my system to work with some of them, helping them solve their personal health mysteries:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>How can i get my V02 back to normal range?</li>
                <li>How consistent is my low blood pressure? Should I be worried?</li>
                <li>How do my different meals impact my insulin levels?</li>
                <li>I’m nervous about dementia- what can I do???</li>
                <li>When am i working best, and how can i get more done in less time?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Thus, GAIA was born.</p>
              <p>I’ll add different things you can log, add different passive sensors, keep the algos and associated recommendations up to date with the most recent research findings, and include the most cutting-edge sensors to help you keep on top of your game.</p>
              <p>So- check out GAIA! If you have something that you’re thinking about that I don’t account for, let me know! I’ll add it in!</p>
