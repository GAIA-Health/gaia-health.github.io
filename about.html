                    <h2 class="mb-4">Why "Women-Led" Matters</h2>
                    <p>Most health tech is built by men for a general audience, then marketed to women as an afterthought. The result? Apps that treat periods like an inconvenient add-on feature.</p>

                    <p>We started with women's health and built everything else around it. Because when you're the one dealing with PCOS, tracking fertility, or managing perimenopause symptoms, you know what actually matters.</p>

                    <p>Women-led means we've been there. We get why privacy matters in a post-Roe world. We understand why you need data you can show your doctor. We know what it's like to track symptoms for months just to have a doctor dismiss them.</p>

                    <p>That's why we built this.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-4">What We're Building</h2>
                    <p>Go Go Gaia is growing. We're adding features, improving algorithms, and staying current with the latest research. If you track something we don't support yet, let us know. We'll add it.</p>

                    <p>Some things we're working on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Better correlation insights that catch patterns you'd never notice</li>
                        <li>More integration with wearables and health devices</li>
                        <li>Smarter predictions that learn from your unique patterns</li>
                        <li>Tools to help you share data with your healthcare providers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We're a small team, so we move fast and listen to users. If something's broken or confusing, we want to know. If you have an idea, we want to hear it.</p>

                <!-- Our Story Section -->
                <section class="mb-5">
                    <h2 class="mb-4">Our Story</h2>

                    <p>I'm a biomedical engineer. Before Go Go Gaia, I was building wearables and analyzing wearable data. I saw firsthand how much health data people were collecting, but also how little they understood about what it meant.</p>

                    <p>The frustration was real. People had dozens of data points from their devices and doctor appointments, but no good way to connect the dots. So I started experimenting with my own tracking system, trying every health app and wearable I could find. Each one got some things right but also plenty wrong.</p>

                    <p>Then I started talking to my friends about it. Turns out a lot of them were dealing with the same issues. They had data from their wearables and doctor appointments but no straightforward way to store it or understand what it meant.</p>

                    <p>So I built a system that worked for me. Then I adapted it to help my friends figure out their health mysteries:</p>

                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>How can I get my VO2 back to normal?</li>
                        <li>How consistent is my low blood pressure? Should I be worried?</li>
                        <li>How do different meals impact my insulin levels?</li>
                        <li>I'm nervous about dementia. What can I do?</li>
                        <li>When am I working best, and how can I get more done in less time?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>That early version of Go Go Gaia helped answer those questions. But as more women started using it, I noticed something. The questions were different:</p>

                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>Why am I exhausted every month around day 21?</li>
                        <li>What triggers my PCOS symptoms?</li>
                        <li>When am I actually ovulating?</li>
                        <li>Are these perimenopause symptoms normal?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Women's health data is complex. Your cycle affects everything: energy, mood, sleep, skin, appetite, focus. But most period trackers just predict your period and call it done.</p>

                    <p>That's not helpful. You need to know <em>why</em> you feel terrible on day 23. You need to see that your headaches always happen when you skip breakfast during your luteal phase. You need data that actually answers questions.</p>

                    <p>So Go Go Gaia evolved. It's built specifically for women's health, with cycle tracking at the center of everything. Because understanding your cycle isn't just about predicting your period. It's about understanding your entire body.</p>
