Always consult your OB-GYN, midwife, or healthcare provider before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine, or lifestyle during pregnancy, especially if you have underlying health conditions or pregnancy complications.

                    <p class="lead">Pregnancy is a remarkable experience that changes your body and life in countless ways. Each trimester brings unique challenges and opportunities for optimizing your health and your baby's development. With the right tracking and wellness practices, you can navigate pregnancy with confidence and joy.</p>

                    <h2>Why Pregnancy Tracking Matters</h2>
                    <p>Tracking your pregnancy health can help you recognize patterns, communicate more effectively with your healthcare provider, and feel more connected to your changing body. When you monitor symptoms, nutrition, and lifestyle factors, you may be better able to identify potential concerns early and maintain awareness of your wellbeing throughout pregnancy. However, tracking should always complement—not replace—regular prenatal care with your healthcare provider.</p>

                    <p>Go Go Gaia's Pregnancy Mode is designed specifically for pregnancy, helping you track everything from morning sickness to kick counts in one comprehensive dashboard.</p>

                    <h2>First Trimester (Weeks 1-12): Foundation Building</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What's Happening</h3>
                    <p>The first trimester is a period of incredible transformation. Your baby's major organs are forming, and your body is adjusting to pregnancy hormones. This is when tracking becomes especially valuable for identifying patterns and managing symptoms.</p>

                    <div class="my-4">
                        <img src="../images/cycle/Hormone_Levels_During_Pregnancy.png"

                    <h3>Key Tracking Areas</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Morning Sickness Patterns</h4>
                    <p>Track when nausea strikes to identify triggers and optimal eating times. Research shows that 70-80% of pregnant women experience morning sickness, but patterns vary widely.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Log nausea intensity (1-10 scale)</li>
                        <li>Note what foods trigger or relieve symptoms</li>
                        <li>Track timing—morning, afternoon, or evening</li>
                        <li>Monitor hydration levels</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Energy and Fatigue</h4>
                    <p>First-trimester fatigue is real and often overwhelming. Tracking your energy levels helps you plan your day effectively.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor energy peaks and crashes</li>
                        <li>Track sleep quality and duration</li>
                        <li>Note activities that boost or drain energy</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Nutrition Tracking</h4>
                    <p>Early pregnancy nutrition is crucial for fetal development. Consult your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian about your specific nutritional needs. Common areas to discuss include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Folic acid:</strong> Your healthcare provider will recommend appropriate supplementation (commonly 400-800 mcg daily is recommended)</li>
                        <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Track iron-rich foods and ask about supplementation needs to prevent anemia</li>
                        <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Discuss protein requirements with your provider (needs vary by individual)</li>
                        <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Ask your healthcare provider about appropriate fluid intake for your pregnancy</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h3>Wellness Tips for First Trimester</h3>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Always consult your healthcare provider before implementing any new wellness practices during pregnancy.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prenatal vitamins:</strong> Ask your healthcare provider about when to start prenatal vitamins—often recommended before conception when planning pregnancy</li>
                        <li><strong>Listen to your body:</strong> Rest when you need it—fatigue is your body's way of telling you to slow down</li>
                        <li><strong>Eat small, frequent meals:</strong> Many women find this helps manage nausea and maintain blood sugar (discuss with your provider)</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Proper hydration may help with morning sickness—ask your doctor about fluid needs</li>
                        <li><strong>Gentle exercise:</strong> With your doctor's approval, activities like walking, swimming, or prenatal yoga may help boost energy</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h2>Second Trimester (Weeks 13-26): The Golden Period</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What's Happening</h3>
                    <p>Often called the "honeymoon phase" of pregnancy, the second trimester brings relief from early symptoms and increased energy. Your baby is growing rapidly, and you'll start feeling those first magical movements.</p>

                    <h3>Key Tracking Areas</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Fetal Movement</h4>
                    <p>Tracking kick counts becomes important in the second trimester. Most women feel their first movements between 16-22 weeks.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Log first movements and patterns</li>
                        <li>Track daily kick counts (starting around 28 weeks)</li>
                        <li>Note baby's active periods</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Weight Gain</h4>
                    <p>Healthy weight gain is crucial. The Institute of Medicine recommends:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Underweight: 28-40 pounds</li>
                        <li>Normal weight: 25-35 pounds</li>
                        <li>Overweight: 15-25 pounds</li>
                        <li>Obese: 11-20 pounds</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Exercise and Activity</h4>
                    <p>Second trimester is ideal for establishing a consistent exercise routine:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Track exercise type, duration, and intensity</li>
                        <li>Monitor how exercise affects energy and sleep</li>
                        <li>Note any discomfort or warning signs</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h3>Wellness Tips for Second Trimester</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Embrace movement:</strong> Regular exercise improves mood, sleep, and labor outcomes</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on posture:</strong> Your growing belly will shift your center of gravity</li>
                        <li><strong>Start belly support:</strong> Maternity belts can reduce back pain</li>
                        <li><strong>Continue healthy eating:</strong> Your baby needs 300 extra calories daily</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare for sleep changes:</strong> Invest in pregnancy pillows</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What's Happening</h3>
                    <p>The final trimester brings rapid growth and preparation for birth. Your baby is gaining weight quickly, and your body is preparing for labor. This is when comprehensive tracking becomes most valuable.</p>

                    <h3>Key Tracking Areas</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Braxton Hicks Contractions</h4>

                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Sleep Quality</h4>

                        <li>Monitor bathroom trips and discomfort</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Swelling and Discomfort</h4>
                    <p>Track swelling patterns to identify concerning symptoms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor ankle and hand swelling</li>
                        <li>Track back pain and pelvic pressure</li>
