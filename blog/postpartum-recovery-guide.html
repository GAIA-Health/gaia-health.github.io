                    <p>You survived labor. The baby is here. Everyone's congratulating you. And you're sitting there, exhausted, bleeding, covered in sweat at 3 AM, thinking: "When does this get easier?"</p>

                    <p>Welcome to the fourth trimester. The 12 weeks after birth that nobody prepares you for.</p>

                    <p>Your hormones just crashed harder than they've ever crashed in your life. Your body is healing from what's essentially a major medical event. You're not sleeping. Your emotions are all over the place. And every online mom forum insists this is "normal," but nobody's explaining what normal actually means or when to worry.</p>

                    <p>Here's what's really happening—and what you need to know to get through it.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2 class="h3 fw-bold mb-3">What Is the Fourth Trimester?</h2>

                    <p>The fourth trimester is weeks 0-12 after birth. It's when your body transitions from pregnancy back to... not pregnant. But that transition isn't instant, and it's not smooth.</p>

                    <p>During pregnancy, your hormones spent 40 weeks climbing to levels 10-100 times higher than normal. Estrogen, progesterone, HCG—all at peak levels to support the baby.</p>

                    <p>Then you deliver the placenta. And within hours, those hormones drop. Not gradually. Not slowly. They crash.</p>

                    <p>This is one of the most dramatic hormonal shifts in human physiology. Bigger than puberty. Bigger than menopause. And your body has to adjust while you're also recovering physically, not sleeping, and learning to keep a tiny human alive.</p>

                    <p>That's the fourth trimester. And it's hard.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="mb-5">
                    <h2 class="h3 fw-bold mb-3">The Hormone Crash: What's Happening</h2>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Estrogen and Progesterone Plummet</h3>
                    <p>During pregnancy, the placenta produces massive amounts of estrogen and progesterone to maintain the pregnancy and prepare your body for birth and breastfeeding.</p>

                    <p><strong>What happens after birth:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Estrogen and progesterone drop by 90% within the first 24 hours after delivery</li>
                        <li>They continue declining over the next 5-7 days, reaching near-baseline levels by week 1-2</li>
                        <li>This crash is steeper and faster than any other hormonal change you'll experience</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
                    <p>Estrogen and progesterone affect mood regulation, sleep quality, temperature regulation, and energy levels. When they crash, you get:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Night sweats:</strong> Your body is adjusting its thermostat without progesterone's warming effect</li>
                        <li><strong>Mood swings:</strong> Estrogen helps regulate serotonin. Less estrogen = more emotional volatility</li>
                        <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Beyond just sleep deprivation—your body is metabolically adjusting</li>
                        <li><strong>Brain fog:</strong> Estrogen affects cognition and memory</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="alert" style="background-color: #f8f4f0; border-left: 4px solid #46583a; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <p class="mb-0"><strong>This is not "just hormones."</strong> This is a massive physiological event. Telling someone "it's just hormones" minimizes how real and intense these changes are. Your body just went through something enormous, and these symptoms are your body adjusting.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Breastfeeding Hormones Rise (If You're Nursing)</h3>
                    <p>If you're breastfeeding, two new hormones take over:</p>

                    <p><strong>Prolactin:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stimulates milk production</li>
                        <li>Rises every time you nurse or pump</li>
                        <li>Suppresses ovulation (nature's way of spacing pregnancies)</li>
                        <li>Can affect mood and energy—some people feel calm, others feel more anxious</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Oxytocin:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Triggers milk letdown reflex</li>
                        <li>Released in pulses during breastfeeding</li>
                        <li>Also causes uterine contractions (those "afterpains" during nursing)</li>
                        <li>Promotes bonding (but doesn't guarantee instant bonding—that's a myth)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These hormones help with milk production but also delay the return of your menstrual cycle. More on that later.</p>

                    <h2 class="h3 fw-bold mb-3">Physical Recovery: What to Expect Week by Week</h2>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Weeks 0-2: The Hardest Phase</h3>
                    <p><strong>What's happening:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lochia (postpartum bleeding):</strong> Heavy bleeding like a very heavy period. Bright red at first, gradually turning pink then brown. Normal for 2-6 weeks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Uterus shrinking:</strong> Your uterus went from fist-sized to watermelon-sized during pregnancy. Now it's contracting back down. You'll feel cramping, especially while breastfeeding (oxytocin causes contractions).</li>
                        <li><strong>Perineal pain:</strong> If you tore or had an episiotomy, you're healing. Sitting hurts. Going to the bathroom is terrifying. Use a peri bottle, ice packs, and witch hazel pads.</li>
                        <li><strong>C-section incision healing:</strong> If you had a C-section, your incision needs 6-8 weeks to heal internally. Moving, lifting, and even coughing can hurt.</li>
                        <li><strong>Breast engorgement:</strong> Milk comes in around day 2-5. Your breasts might feel rock-hard and painful until supply regulates.</li>
                        <li><strong>Night sweats:</strong> Drenching sweats as your body sheds pregnancy fluid and adjusts hormones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme fatigue:</strong> You're not sleeping more than 2-3 hours at a time. Your body is healing. This is survival mode.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>What helps:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take pain medication as prescribed—don't try to tough it out</li>
                        <li>Rest whenever the baby sleeps (ignore the housework)</li>
                        <li>Accept help—let others cook, clean, hold the baby while you shower</li>
                        <li>Stay hydrated (especially if breastfeeding)</li>
                        <li>Use cooling pads, sitz baths, stool softeners</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Weeks 3-6: Still Healing, Slightly Less Awful</h3>
                    <p><strong>What's happening:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bleeding slows:</strong> Lochia should be lighter now—pink or brown discharge. If it suddenly turns bright red again, call your doctor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Uterus almost back to normal:</strong> By 6 weeks postpartum, your uterus is nearly back to pre-pregnancy size.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perineal healing:</strong> Most tearing or episiotomies heal by week 4-6, but you might still feel tenderness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Energy slightly improving:</strong> You're still exhausted, but maybe you can walk around the block without feeling wrecked.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emotions stabilizing:</strong> If you had baby blues, they usually lift by week 3. If they don't, it might be postpartum depression (more below).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>What helps:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Bleeding stops:</strong> By 6-8 weeks, lochia should be done. If not, see your doctor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical healing mostly complete:</strong> Incisions healed, perineum recovered, uterus back to size.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hormones stabilizing:</strong> Still not back to pre-pregnancy levels, but no longer in freefall.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sleep slightly better:</strong> Some babies start sleeping in longer stretches (but not all—don't compare yourself to Instagram moms).</li>

                    <p>50-80% of new mothers experience "baby blues" in the first 2 weeks. This is different from postpartum depression (PPD), which affects 10-15% of new mothers and requires treatment.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Baby Blues (Normal, Temporary)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Starts around day 2-3 after birth, peaks around day 5-7, resolves by week 2-3</p>

                    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The hormone crash, sleep deprivation, and life adjustment</p>

                    <p><strong>What helps:</strong> Rest, support, talking about how you feel, time</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Postpartum Depression (Needs Treatment)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>

                        <li>Persistent sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness that doesn't lift</li>

                    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, history of depression, lack of support, birth trauma</p>

                    <h2 class="h3 fw-bold mb-3">When Does Your Period Return?</h2>

                    <p>This is one of the most common postpartum questions—and the answer depends on whether you're breastfeeding.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">If You're Not Breastfeeding</h3>
                    <p>Your period typically returns <strong>6-12 weeks</strong> after birth. Most people get their first postpartum period around 8-10 weeks.</p>

                    <p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your first period might be heavier or lighter than normal</li>
                        <li>It might be irregular for the first few cycles</li>
                        <li>Ovulation can happen 2-4 weeks before your first period, so you CAN get pregnant before your period returns</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">If You're Breastfeeding</h3>
                    <p>Breastfeeding delays ovulation and menstruation due to elevated prolactin levels. But timing varies widely:</p>

                    <p><strong>Exclusively breastfeeding (no formula, no long gaps between feeds):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Period might not return for 6+ months, sometimes up to 12+ months</li>
                        <li>The more frequently you nurse, the longer menstruation is suppressed</li>
                        <li>Night nursing is especially important for delaying ovulation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Combination feeding (breast + formula):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Period returns sooner, often within 3-6 months</li>
                        <li>Less breastfeeding = faster return of ovulation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>When baby starts solids or sleeping through the night:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nursing frequency drops, prolactin levels drop, ovulation returns</li>
                        <li>Many people get their first period around 6-9 months postpartum when this happens</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p class="mb-0"><strong>Important:</strong> You can ovulate BEFORE your first postpartum period. If you don't want to get pregnant right away, use birth control even if you haven't had a period yet. "Breastfeeding as birth control" only works under very specific conditions (exclusive breastfeeding, baby under 6 months, no period return)—and even then it's only 98% effective.</p>

                    <p>Pregnancy and birth put a lot of stress on your pelvic floor—the muscles that support your bladder, uterus, and bowels. Recovery is important, but it takes time.</p>

                    <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Common Postpartum Pelvic Floor Issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Urinary leaking:</strong> When you cough, sneeze, laugh, or jump</li>
                        <li><strong>Painful sex:</strong> Vaginal dryness (especially if breastfeeding), scar tissue, muscle tension</li>
                        <li><strong>Pelvic pressure or heaviness:</strong> Possible pelvic organ prolapse</li>
                        <li><strong>Back or hip pain:</strong> Pelvic floor dysfunction can cause referred pain</li>
                        <li><strong>Bowel issues:</strong> Constipation or trouble controlling bowel movements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>What helps:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pelvic floor physical therapy (not just Kegels—see a specialist)</li>
                        <li>Gradual return to exercise (avoid high-impact too soon)</li>
                        <li>Core and pelvic floor coordination (not just strengthening)</li>
                        <li>Address diastasis recti if present (abdominal separation)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Don't accept "this is just part of being a mom." Leaking and pain are common, but they're treatable. See a pelvic floor PT if you're having any of these issues.</p>

                    <p>The fourth trimester is hard. Harder than most people admit.</p>

                    <p>Your hormones crashed. Your body is healing from something massive. You're not sleeping. You're learning to care for a newborn. And everyone expects you to be glowing and grateful.</p>

                    <p>You can be grateful and struggling at the same time. You can love your baby and miss your old life. You can be healing and also need help.</p>

                    <p>What's normal:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bleeding for 4-6 weeks</li>
                        <li>Feeling exhausted</li>
                        <li>Night sweats</li>
                        <li>Mood swings in the first 2 weeks</li>
                        <li>Soreness and pain while healing</li>
                        <li>Not feeling "back to normal" for months</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>What's not normal (and needs a doctor):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heavy bleeding that soaks through a pad in an hour</li>
                        <li>Fever, severe pain, or foul-smelling discharge</li>
                        <li>Depression or anxiety that lasts longer than 2 weeks</li>
                        <li>Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby</li>
                        <li>Physical symptoms getting worse instead of better</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Recovery takes 6-12 weeks physically. Emotionally and hormonally? Longer. And that's okay.</p>

                    <p>Ask for help. Track your symptoms. Trust your gut when something feels wrong. And give yourself more grace than you think you need.</p>

                    <p>You just did something incredible. Your body needs time to recover.</p>
