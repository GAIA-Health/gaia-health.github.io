## Keyword Research Strategy

### Keyword Selection Criteria
✅ Use keywords that have:
- Search volume: 1,000+ monthly searches (minimum)
- Difficulty: Low to Medium (under 60)
- Intent: Informational or transactional
- Relevance: Directly relates to cycle/hormone health

❌ Avoid keywords that:

### Tools for Keyword Research
- **Ubersuggest** - Free, good for basics
- **Google Keyword Planner** - Free, search volume data
- **AnswerThePublic** - Free, question-based keywords
- **Google Search Console** - See what you already rank for
- **Competitor sites** - See what keywords competitors rank for

### Long-Tail Keyword Strategy
Target question-based keywords:
- "How to [action]"
- "What is [concept]"
- "Why does [symptom] happen"
- "When to [action]"
- "[Symptom] during [phase]"

**Example:**
- Primary: "hormone imbalance" (22,200/mo, high competition)
- Long-tail: "signs of hormone imbalance in your 30s" (480/mo, low competition)
- Long-tail: "how to tell if you have hormone imbalance" (720/mo, medium competition)

## Content Differentiation Strategy

### What Makes Our Content Different

**1. Cycle Phase Specificity**
- Don't just say "eat healthy" - say "eat iron-rich foods during your period"
- Don't just say "exercise" - say "HIIT during follicular, yoga during menstrual"

**2. Tracking Angle**
- Every post includes "how to track this with Go Go Gaia"
- Emphasize pattern recognition and insights
- Show correlation features

**3. Warmth + Science Balance**
- Start with empathy/relatability
- Back up with science
- End with actionable steps

**4. Real Examples**
- Use specific schedules (not just "exercise more")
- Include actual meal ideas (not just "eat vegetables")
- Show sample tracking screens/data

**5. Comprehensive**
- Cover edge cases (irregular cycles, birth control, perimenopause)
- Include troubleshooting sections
- Address "but what if..." objections

## Content Repurposing Strategy

### From Blog to Other Channels

**One blog post can become:**

2. **Video script** (TikTok/Reels)
3. **Email newsletter** (summary + link)
4. **Infographic** (visual summary)
5. **Podcast episode** (if starting one)
6. **Thread** (Twitter/Threads)
7. **LinkedIn post** (professional angle)
8. **Pinterest pins** (with graphics)

**Example: "10 PCOS Symptoms" blog post →**
- Instagram: Carousel with 1 symptom per slide
- TikTok: "5 signs you might have PCOS" (60 sec)
- Email: "Do you have these PCOS symptoms?" + CTA
- Infographic: PCOS symptom checklist
- Pinterest: Pin linking to full article
