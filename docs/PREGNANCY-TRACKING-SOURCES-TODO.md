## 💡 NOTES

- **Legal protection:** Because this is pregnancy content, we need to be EXTRA careful about sources and disclaimers. When in doubt, cite it or remove it.
- **ACOG is gold standard:** For anything related to pregnancy care guidelines, ACOG is the authoritative source to cite.
- **Individual variation language:** Make sure every recommendation acknowledges that pregnancies vary and providers give personalized advice.
- **No fear-mongering:** Balance providing important warning sign information with maintaining an empowering, supportive tone.
- **Consider professional review:** Given the high-stakes nature of pregnancy content, consider having an OB-GYN review for medical accuracy before major promotion.

## 📞 QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

1. **Do we want to include specific weight gain ranges by BMI?**
   - Currently deferred to providers (safest approach)
   - If we add specifics, MUST cite CDC guidelines and include heavy disclaimers

2. **Should we include more specific kick counting methods?**
   - Currently general guidance
   - Could add specific "Count to 10" method details if we cite ACOG bulletin

3. **Do we want to discuss home dopplers?**
   - Currently briefly mentioned with caution
   - ACOG discourages use without medical supervision

4. **Mental health screening tools - include specifics?**
   - Could mention Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (validated for prenatal too)
   - Would need to cite research on screening

5. **Nutrition specifics?**
   - Currently very general
   - Could expand with citations, but increases scope
