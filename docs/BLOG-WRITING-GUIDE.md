## Legal & Medical Compliance

### ⚠️ ALWAYS Include Medical Disclaimer

**EVERY blog post that discusses health, hormones, symptoms, nutrition, or medical topics MUST include this disclaimer at the top:**

```html
<div class="alert alert-warning border-warning">
    <h4><i class="bi bi-info-circle me-2"></i>Medical Disclaimer</h4>
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>This article is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.</strong> The information provided is based on general wellness principles and should not replace consultation with qualified healthcare professionals. Always consult your doctor, gynecologist, or healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet, exercise routine, or lifestyle, especially if you have underlying health conditions, irregular cycles, PCOS, endometriosis, or other medical concerns. If you experience severe menstrual symptoms, please seek medical attention. Individual results may vary, and what works for one person may not work for another.</p>
</div>
```

**Customize for specific topics:**
- **Pregnancy posts:** Add "Always consult your OB-GYN before making any changes during pregnancy"

## Sources & Citations

### Why Sources Matter

1. **Credibility** - Readers trust backed-up claims
2. **SEO** - Google favors well-researched content
3. **Legal protection** - Shows you're not making unfounded claims
4. **Authority** - Positions Go Go Gaia as expert resource

### What Needs Citations

**Always cite:**
- Specific statistics ("40% of women...")
- Research findings ("Studies show...")
- Medical/scientific claims about hormones, body processes
- Historical facts or timelines
- Expert quotes
- Nutritional recommendations

**Don't need citations:**
- General common knowledge ("menstruation happens monthly")
- Personal anecdotes
- App features you're describing
- Your own opinions (when clearly labeled as such)

### Credible Sources

**Tier 1 (Best):**
- Peer-reviewed journal articles (PubMed, Google Scholar)
- Government health agencies (NIH, CDC, ACOG)
- Major medical institutions (Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins)
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

**Tier 2 (Good):**
- Reputable health organizations (American Heart Association, etc.)
- University research publications
- Medical textbooks
- Evidence-based health websites (Harvard Health, WebMD with caution)

**Tier 3 (Use Sparingly):**
- Health blogs (only if backed by experts)
- News articles about health (check original source)
- Books by health professionals

**NEVER use:**
- Random blogs without credentials
- Social media posts
- Sponsored content or ads
- Outdated sources (>10 years old for science topics)

### How to Cite

**In-text citation format:**

```html
<p>Research suggests that estrogen levels influence serotonin production.<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12345678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a></sup></p>
```

**References section at bottom:**

```html
<h2>References</h2>
<ol class="references">
    <li>Author Name, et al. "Study Title." Journal Name. Year. <a href="[URL]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a></li>
    <li>Organization Name. "Article Title." Website Name. Accessed [Date]. <a href="[URL]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a></li>
</ol>
```

### Source-Finding Workflow

1. **Make your claim** in draft
2. **Search PubMed** for peer-reviewed studies
3. **Check major health org websites** for supporting info
4. **If no source found** - soften claim or remove it
5. **Add citation** immediately (don't wait until end)
6. **Note source** in BLOG-CONTENT-TODO.md if you need to find it later

## Images & Visual Content

### Why Images Matter

- Increase engagement by 94%
- Improve time on page
- Boost social shares
- Break up text walls
- Improve SEO (via image search)

### Image Requirements

**Technical specs:**
- **Format:** WebP (first choice) or JPG/PNG
- **Size:** Compressed (use TinyPNG.com) - aim for under 200KB

  - In-content: 800-1000px wide max
  - Thumbnails: 400x300px

**Every image must have:**
- **Alt text:** Descriptive, includes keywords naturally

### Alt Text Guidelines

**Good alt text:**
- Describes what's in the image
- Includes relevant keywords naturally
- Is concise (125 characters or less)
- Helps visually impaired users understand content

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: "image1.jpg"
❌ Bad: "cycle syncing cycle tracking menstrual health woman" (keyword stuffing)
✅ Good: "Woman doing gentle yoga stretch during menstrual phase of cycle"
✅ Good: "Chart showing estrogen and progesterone levels throughout 28-day menstrual cycle"

2. **Infographics** - Data visualization, processes, comparisons
3. **Charts/graphs** - Hormone curves, statistics
4. **Stock photos** - Relevant, diverse, authentic-looking
