**Key Differentiator:**
Focus on the "why track?" and "what do I do with this data?" - not just listing symptoms but explaining their significance and how to use patterns for health advocacy.

**Voice:**
Empowering but practical. This should make tracking feel accessible, not overwhelming. "Start small, track what matters to you."
